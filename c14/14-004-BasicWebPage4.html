        There are two types of programs you can create with Java: applications and applets. 
        <p />
        <b>Applications</b>
        <br />
        An <i>application</i> is a stand-alone program that runs on your computer. 
        <p />
        <b>Applets</b>
        <br />
        <i>Applets</i> are Java programs that are usually part of a Web site. They are stored on a Web server along with the site's Web pages. When a remote user accesses a Web page with his or her browser, any applets associated with the Web page are transmitted over the Internet from the server to the remote user's system.
